# Repo-Search

The advanced git search engine

---

## What is it?

The GitHub Repo Search Engine is an engine used to find repos for those of all levels of skill - beginners and experts alike - to contribute to.

## Why?

When you are just starting programming, one of the best ways to build skills is to help on open source projects. These projects will teach you many skills that have real job application or useful program methods and implementations. Alongside this, experts will be able to help out beginners with the more technological aspects of their programs - as this engine brings to light many less advertised repos, that will now be more likely to be discoverd. With this engine, a greater diversity of repos will receive assistance, and beginners and experts alike will benefit.
