# Naming Conventions
**All names** - Avoid any names that are similar to methods and functions that are built in, or part of an installed package.
</br></br>
## JS
**HTML elements** - `PascalCase` with one or two words describing the element, its purpose, etc. </br></br>
**JS Constants** - `PascalCase` with one or two words describing the purpose of the constant.</br></br>
**JS Functions** - `camelCase`, first letter lowercase, one or two words describing what the function does.</br></br>
**JS Variables** - `snake_case`, one or two words describing variable purpose.</br></br>
**React useState** - `camelCase`. 1 to 3 words. For variable name the scheme is `objectDescription`, reulting in `objectDescription`.
The following method's naming system is `set` followed by a `PascalCase` variable - resulting in `setObjectDescription` -
`[objectDescription, setObjectDescription] = useState(value);`</br></br>
**HTML Classes** - `kebab-case` - one or two words describing the element.</br></br>
**HTML ID'S** - one string, no spaces, describing the element - like `thatoneid`. Ex. `alllangs`. Keep it a reasonable length (less than 10 characters is
generally a good guideline)</br></br>
**Pages** - `Capital.jsx`, name the main function of that page the same as the file name - end file in .jsx - one word, capitalized - use `PascalCase` if two
words is ***NECESSARY***</br></br>
**Exceptions** - There may be exceptions to some of these rules. Read [here][1]
## Python

## Exceptions
Sometimes while naming something, you may encounter an obstacle, or feel a different naming style would be better for this specific situation. Just use your best judgement if you feel that a, in a specific case, the naming schemes shouldn't apply - these conventions are for ease of reading, programming, and additions by others. However, as long as you feel a different name fits this, and would be better with a different convention -- Go for it.
