# Frontend Contributions
The frontend of the repo-search search engine is created with the reactjs web framework.

## Basics
To contribute clone the repo:</br>
`git clone https://github.com/lucasrpatten/repo-search.git`</br>
`cd repo-search`</br>
Then:</br>
`cd static # will most likely be changed to web soon`</br>
`npm i`</br>
</br>
**To run the development server and build for production (respectively)**</br>
`npm run dev`</br>
`npm run build`</br>

Now do whatever and pull request whenever (add to this later and stuff)
